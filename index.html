<p><a href="https://koekeishiya.github.io/kwm"><em>Kwm</em></a> started as a simple project to get true focus-follows-mouse support on OSX through event tapping. It is now a tiling window manager that represents windows as the leaves of a binary tree. <em>Kwm</em> supports binary space partitioned, monocle and floating spaces.  </p>

<p><em>Kwm</em> uses the event taps API (Quartz Event Services) to observe, filter and alter user input events prior to their delivery to a foreground application. This allows for functionality such as focus-follows-mouse, and different types of hotkeys.  </p>

<p><em>Kwm</em> runs a local daemon to read messages and trigger functions.<br>
<em>Kwmc</em> is used to write to <em>Kwm</em>'s socket, and must be used when interacting with and configuring how <em>Kwm</em> works. For a list of various commands that can be issued, check the readme located within the <em>kwmc</em> folder. The <em>Kwmc</em> tool also has a built-in help system that can be accessed from the terminal using <code>kwmc help</code>.  </p>

<p><em>Kwm</em> requires access to the OSX accessibility API.<br>
Tested on El Capitan (10.11.1 / 10.11.2).</p>

<h2>
<a id="extended-information" class="anchor" href="#extended-information" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Extended Information:</h2>

<p>The different features; binary space partitioning, focus-follows-mouse and the hotkey-system can all be enabled independently. This allows the user to choose which functionality to enable depending on their workflow.  </p>

<p><em>Binary Space Partitioning:</em><br>
Kwm tiles windows using a binary-tree structure. For information, check the usage section.  </p>

<p><em>Focus-Follows-Mouse:</em><br>
Both autofocus and autoraise is available, however autofocus only redirects key input to the window below the cursor, the menubar is not accessible. Autoraise gives a window focus and raises it to the front. By default <em>Kwm</em> is set to use autoraise as it is meant to be used alongside the tiling functionality, and so windows should not overlap unless a window is specifically made floating.  </p>

<p><em>System-Wide Hotkeys:</em><br>
Kwm allows the user to bind and unbind hotkeys to commands through the <em>Kwmc</em> tool, using a bind and unbind option. These binds support the use of a single prefix, which may be bind-specific or global (apply to all binds). There are 3 types of hotkeys: global, global + blacklist applications, specified applications. Using hotkeys to change window focus will work even if focus-follows-mouse has been disabled.  </p>

<p><em>Multiple monitor support:</em><br>
Kwm supports external monitors and have commands that allow for focusing screens, moving windows, and capturing applications. For more information, see kwmc help screen and kwmc config capture.</p>

<h2>
<a id="build" class="anchor" href="#build" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Build:</h2>

<p>Because there is no app bundle, <em>Kwm</em> has to be started from a terminal.<br>
To compile and start <em>Kwm</em>, simply run</p>

<pre><code>  make
  ./bin/kwm
</code></pre>

<p>By default, debug prints are enabled, and these can be turned off by running</p>

<pre><code>  make install
</code></pre>

<p>To make <em>Kwm</em> start automatically on login, run the following command the first time <em>Kwm</em> starts </p>

<pre><code>  kwmc config launchd enable
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="configuration" class="anchor" href="#configuration" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Configuration:</h2>

<p>The default configuration file is <code>$HOME/.kwm/kwmrc</code> and is a script that contains <em>Kwmc</em> commands to be executed when <em>Kwm</em> starts. This file can be used to blacklist applications and specify a variety of settings, as well as run any command not restricted to <em>Kwmc</em>.  </p>

<p><em>Kwm</em> can apply all of these settings during runtime, and so live testing of options is possible<br>
before writing them into the config file.</p>

<p>A sample config can be found within the <a href="examples">examples</a> directory.</p>

<h2>
<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage:</h2>

<p>When <em>Kwm</em> starts, it will automatically tile the windows of the current space using the tiling mode set in the config file. By default, it will use binary space partitioning. This will also happen once for any other space the user might switch to.</p>

<p>When <em>Kwm</em> detects a new window, it is inserted into a window tree using an insertion point, with the given split-mode. When a window is closed, it will be removed from the window tree and the tree will be rebalanced. By default, the insertion point is the focused container, but a temporary insertion point can be set.  </p>

<p>There are 3 types of split-modes available:</p>

<ul>
<li>Optimal - uses width/height ratio (default)</li>
<li>Vertical</li>
<li>Horizontal<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>          a                       a                       a
         / \         --&gt;         / \         --&gt;         / \    
        1   2                   1   b                   1   b
                                   / \                     / \
                                  3   2                   c   2
                                                         / \
                                                        4   3

<p>By taking advantage of the fact that bsp-trees can be saved and restored<br>
from file, it is trivial to create layouts that can be loaded on the press<br>
of a hotkey. This allows the user to quickly get a given space to tile<br>
according to their needs as they change through the day.<br>
To save/restore a bsp-layout, see <code>kwmc help tree</code>.  </p>

<p>In addition to bsp, <em>Kwm</em> supports both monocle and floating spaces.<br>
If a space is set to floating mode, nothing will be tiled for this space.<br>
If a space is in monocle mode, every window will run fullscreen, and the<br>
user can switch between open windows using the kwmc command <code>window -f prev|next</code>.  </p>

<p>If a window is not detected by Kwm, it is most likely due to a 'window role' mismatch.<br>
Use the command <code>kwmc config add-role role application</code> to fix this.<br>
