<a id="brief-description" class="anchor" href="#brief-description" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Brief Description</h2>

<p><a href="https://koekeishiya.github.io/kwm"><em>Kwm</em></a> started as a simple project to get true focus-follows-mouse support on OSX through event tapping.
It is now a tiling window manager that represents windows as the leaves of a binary tree.
<em>Kwm</em> supports binary space partitioned, monocle and floating spaces.</p>

<p><em>Kwm</em> uses the event taps API (Quartz Event Services) to observe, filter and alter user input events prior
to their delivery to a foreground application. This allows for functionality such as focus-follows-mouse,
and different types of hotkeys.</p>

<p><em>Kwm</em> runs a local daemon to read messages and trigger functions.
<em>Kwmc</em> is used to write to <em>Kwm</em>'s socket, and must be used when interacting with and configuring how <em>Kwm</em> works.
For a list of various commands that can be issued, check the readme located within the <em>kwmc</em> folder.
The <em>Kwmc</em> tool also has a built-in help system that can be accessed from the terminal using <code>kwmc help</code>.</p>

<p>For in depth information, sample configurations, and useful scripts to implement new features by combining
kwmc commands, check out the <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/kwm/wiki">wiki</a></p>

<p><em>Kwm</em> requires access to the OSX accessibility API.
Tested on El Capitan (10.11.1 - 10.11.3).</p>

<h2>
<a id="extended-information" class="anchor" href="#extended-information" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Extended Information:</h2>

<p>The different features; binary space partitioning, focus-follows-mouse and the hotkey-system can all be enabled
independently. This allows the user to choose which functionality to enable depending on their workflow.</p>

<p><em>Binary Space Partitioning:</em>
Kwm tiles windows using a binary-tree structure. For information, check the usage section.</p>

<p><em>Focus-Follows-Mouse:</em>
Both autofocus and autoraise is available, however autofocus only redirects key input to the window below the cursor,
the menubar is not accessible. Autoraise gives a window focus and raises it to the front.  By default <em>Kwm</em> is set to
use autoraise as it is meant to be used alongside the tiling functionality, and so windows should not overlap unless
a window is specifically made floating.</p>

<p><em>System-Wide Hotkeys:</em>
Kwm allows the user to bind and unbind hotkeys to commands through the <em>Kwmc</em> tool, using a bind and unbind option.
These binds support the use of a single prefix, which may be bind-specific or global (apply to all binds).
There are 3 types of hotkeys: global, global + blacklist applications, specified applications.
Using hotkeys to change window focus will work even if focus-follows-mouse has been disabled.</p>

<p><em>Multiple monitor support:</em>
Kwm supports external monitors and have commands that allow for focusing screens,  moving windows, and capturing applications.
For more information, see <code>kwmc help screen</code> and <code>kwmc config capture</code>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="install" class="anchor" href="#install" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install:</h2>

<p>A codesigned binary release is available through Homebrew</p>

<pre><code>  brew install homebrew/binary/kwm
</code></pre>

<p>To compile from source</p>

<pre><code>  make install
</code></pre>

<p>Build with debug information</p>

<pre><code>  make
</code></pre>

<p>To make <em>Kwm</em> start automatically on login through launchd, if compiled from source</p>

<pre><code>  edit /path/to/kwm on line 9 of examples/com.koekeishiya.kwm.plist
  cp examples/com.koekeishiya.kwm.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
</code></pre>

<p>I would recommend for <em>Kwm</em> to be managed by launchd, as it otherwise requires
the terminal application to have Accessibility Permissions (Not Recommended).</p>

<h2>
<a id="configuration" class="anchor" href="#configuration" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Configuration:</h2>

<p>The default configuration file is <code>$HOME/.kwm/kwmrc</code> and is a script that contains <em>Kwmc</em> commands
to be executed when <em>Kwm</em> starts. This file can be used to blacklist applications and specify
a variety of settings, as well as run any command not restricted to <em>Kwmc</em>.</p>

<p><em>Kwm</em> can apply all of these settings during runtime, and so live testing of options is possible
before writing them into the config file.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, the file <code>$HOME/.kwm/init</code> is a shell script that will be ran after
<em>Kwm</em> has finished setting up the internal configuration.</p>

<p>A sample config and init file can be found within the <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/kwm/tree/master/examples">examples</a> directory.</p>

<p>Note: The sample configuration and information is updated to follow Kwm @ master. If you are running a release
version of Kwm, be aware that the documentation in this github repository may not always apply.</p>

<h2>
<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage:</h2>

<p>When <em>Kwm</em> starts, it will automatically tile the windows of the current space using the tiling mode set in the config file.
By default, it will use binary space partitioning. This will also happen once for any other space the user might switch to.</p>

<p>When <em>Kwm</em> detects a new window, it is inserted into a window tree using an insertion point, with the given split-mode.
When a window is closed, it will be removed from the window tree and the tree will be rebalanced.
By default, the insertion point is the focused container, but a temporary insertion point can be set.</p>

<p>There are 3 types of split-modes available:</p>

<ul>
<li>Optimal - uses width/height ratio (default)</li>
<li>Vertical</li>
<li>Horizontal</li>
</ul>

<p>A node in the bsp-tree can be in 2 different states:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tree Node</li>
<li>Link Node</li>
</ul>

<p>Example of a bsp-tree consisting of only Tree Nodes:</p>

<p>In addition to bsp, <em>Kwm</em> supports both monocle and floating spaces.
If a space is set to floating mode, Kwm will ignore this space.
If a space is in monocle mode, every window will run fullscreen.</p>

<p>If a window is not detected by Kwm, it is most likely due to a 'window role' mismatch.
Use the command <code>kwmc config add-role role application</code> to fix this.
See <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/kwm/issues/40">https://github.com/koekeishiya/kwm/issues/40</a> for information.</p>

<p>First of all, Kwm will always be free and open source, however some users have
expressed interest in some way to show their support.</p>

<p>If you wish to do so, I have set up a patreon <a href="https://www.patreon.com/aasvi">here</a>.</p>
